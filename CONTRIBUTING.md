## Skill Quality Standards

Every new skill must include:

- ✅ Frontmatter following v2.0 standard (see `skills/en/_TEMPLATE.md`)
- ✅ Clear `triggers:` list (3–7 trigger phrases matching user intent)
- ✅ Information-gathering protocol (max 4 questions)
- ✅ Structured output template (tables, not pure prose)
- ✅ Cross-references to related skills
- ✅ Quality checklist (built-in self-review)
- ✅ At least 1 example output (in `examples/` or inline)
- ✅ Under 500 lines — move long lookup tables, platform checklists, and extended templates into `skills/<lang>/<skill>/references/*.md` and link to them from a pointer line (progressive disclosure; see `34-ai-marketing-os` for the pattern)

Run `./validate-skills.sh` (or `.\validate-skills.ps1` on Windows) before opening a PR. Target: **Issues: 0**.

Vietnamese skills write their body in **unaccented Vietnamese** (technical terms stay in English: ROAS, CPL, TOFU/MOFU/BOFU). This is a repo-wide convention that avoids encoding issues when skills are loaded into different AI platforms.

## Translation Guidelines

When translating Vietnam Edition → Global Edition:

### Translate literally
- ✅ Frameworks (5 Whys, JTBD, RACI, persona templates, funnel stages)
- ✅ Methodology (question protocol, output structure, quality checklist)
- ✅ Cross-reference logic

### Adapt, don't translate
- 🔄 **Currency** — VND → USD with regional context (not just exchange rate; rebase to local purchasing power)
- 🔄 **Benchmarks** — Pull from `references/benchmarks-global.md` instead of literal VN numbers
- 🔄 **Channels** — Zalo OA → Email/SMS; Shopee VN → Shopify/Amazon; TikTok Shop VN → TikTok Shop US/UK
- 🔄 **Examples** — Spa VN → DTC skincare US; F&B VN → DTC food brand US/UK
- 🔄 **Compliance** — VN advertising law → FTC, GDPR, CCPA references
- 🔄 **Cultural context** — VN buying behavior (COD-heavy, Zalo trust) → US/EU (credit card, review-driven)

## Benchmark Contributions

If you add regional benchmarks (e.g., for a country not yet covered):

1. **Cite at least 2 independent sources** with publication dates
2. **Use medians, not averages** (unless explicitly noted otherwise)
3. **Specify date ranges** (e.g., "Q4 2025 data")
4. **Format consistently** with existing `references/benchmarks-*.md` files
5. **Include both "poor/average/good/excellent" bands** where applicable

## Pull Request Process

1. Update your branch with latest `master`
2. Ensure your PR description explains: what, why, testing done
3. Tag with relevant labels (`translation`, `new-skill`, `bug`, etc.)
4. We review within 1 week
5. Merged PRs get credit in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and changelog

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. Be specific. Be useful. Disagree on technical merit, never on identity.
