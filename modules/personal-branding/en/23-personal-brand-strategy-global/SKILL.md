# Personal Brand Strategy (12-Month Plan) — Global

> "Personal brand isn't what you think you are — it's what others recognize you as when you're not in the room."
>
> This skill produces a complete 12-month plan: niche selection, positioning, story arc, content pillars, authority ladder, and a quarter-by-quarter growth roadmap. Read the context file from skill 22 first.

---

## Newbie section

### Who this skill is for

| Audience | Concrete example |
|----------|-----------------|
| Founder / CEO | Wants a 12-month plan to grow a personal brand alongside the company |
| Coach / Consultant | Needs a roadmap from "no one knows me" to "expert booked solid" |
| Creator / KOL | Wants strategic follower growth, not random posting |

### Who this skill is NOT for

- **Product marketing for a company** -> use skill `00-marketing-plan-global`
- **Agencies serving clients** -> use `20-client-intake-brief-global`
- **No personal context yet** -> run skill `22-personal-brand-context-global` first

### Before invoking

**Required:** the file `.agents/personal-brand-context-global.md` must exist — run skill 22 first. It contains niche, audience, north star, brand voice — skill 23 reads it so you don't re-answer.

### Troubleshooting

1. **"Context file not found"** -> run `skill 22-personal-brand-context-global` first
2. **"Niche too broad"** -> narrow with the 3x3 grid (see Niche Selection)
3. **"Don't know how to write story arc"** -> use the 3 fill-in prompts in Story Arc
4. **"12 months feels overwhelming"** -> focus Q1 only, review every quarter

---

## Step 0: Read context (skill 22)

Check whether `.agents/personal-brand-context-global.md` exists:

- **Yes** -> read fully, extract 4 essentials:
  1. **Niche** — chosen domain of expertise
  2. **Audience** — specific target persona
  3. **North Star** — 12-month goal
  4. **Monetization goal** — how the brand earns
- **No** -> ask the user to run `22-personal-brand-context-global` first.
  If they want to continue anyway, ask 3 minimum questions:
  1. What do you do, and what are you best at?
  2. What do you want to be known for?
  3. What is your goal for the next 12 months?

## Niche Selection Framework

### Personal Ikigai — 4 overlapping zones

```
        Passion (What do you love?)
              |
  Skill ------+------ Demand
(What are you      (What does the
 great at?)         market want?)
              |
        Uniqueness
   (What makes you different?)
```

**Strong niche = intersection of all 4 zones.** Missing one -> weak niche.

### 3x3 Grid — Choose niche from 9 candidates

**Step 1:** List 3 passions + 3 skills.

| | Skill 1: [___] | Skill 2: [___] | Skill 3: [___] |
|---|---|---|---|
| Passion 1: [___] | Niche A | Niche B | Niche C |
| Passion 2: [___] | Niche D | Niche E | Niche F |
| Passion 3: [___] | Niche G | Niche H | Niche I |

**Step 2:** Score each niche.

| Niche | Demand (1-5) | Uniqueness (1-5) | Total |
|-------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| A | ? | ? | ? |
| B | ? | ? | ? |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Step 3:** Pick the top 1-2 niches with the highest score (minimum 6/10).

### Global niche examples (2025–2026)

> "A niche must be big enough to have an audience, small enough that you are the expert."

| Example niche | Demand | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| AI for SMBs (Western Europe) | 5 | Hot, but high competition |
| Healthcare marketing (US) | 4 | Small niche, fewer rivals, premium fees |
| Personal finance for Gen Z (US/UK) | 5 | Huge audience, multiple formats |
| B2B sales coaching (LATAM) | 3 | Narrow, high-ticket willingness |
| Content strategy for SaaS (global) | 3 | Emerging, still few specialists |
| Conversational English (SEA) | 4 | Constant demand, competitive |
| Startup team-building (global) | 3 | Founder audience, monetizes well |
| Cross-border ecommerce (EU/SEA) | 4 | 2025 trend, strong demand |
| Workplace mental health (US/EU) | 4 | Post-COVID growth |
| Personal finance for freelancers (global) | 3 | Small niche, high loyalty |

---

## Positioning Statement

### Formula

```
"I help [AUDIENCE] achieve [OUTCOME] through [UNIQUE METHOD] in [TIMELINE]."
```

### 3 real examples (international)

**Founder:**
> "I help early-stage SaaS founders reach 1,000 LinkedIn followers in 90 days
> using a systematic Build-in-Public framework."

**Coach:**
> "I help mid-level managers boost team performance by 30% in 6 months
> through 1:1 coaching combined with internal workshops."

**Creator:**
> "I help working Gen Z professionals master personal finance in 30 days
> through short-form videos that explain concepts with everyday examples."

### Positioning sanity check — 4 questions

| Question | Must be answerable |
|----------|--------------------|
| **Who?** | A specific audience (not "everyone") |
| **What problem?** | Clear pain point or desire |
| **How?** | A distinctive method or approach |
| **Different how?** | A clear edge over 3-5 peers |

If you can't answer all four — you're not ready to position. Return to Niche Selection.

## Story Arc — 3 Chapters

> A story arc is the narrative spine of your personal brand — not a CV but a JOURNEY. People remember stories, not lists of credentials.

### Hero's Journey adapted for personal brand

```
Chapter 1: ORIGIN              Chapter 2: TURNING POINT       Chapter 3: NOW
(Why did you start?)      ->   (What changed you?)        ->  (What are you doing?)
- Personal pain point          - "Aha" moment                  - Current mission
- Background (family/career)   - Biggest failure               - Who you help, how
- Original motivation          - Core lesson                   - Future vision
```

### 3 fill-in prompts

**Prompt 1 — Origin:**
> "Before I worked in [current field], I was [former role/situation].
> What pushed me to start was [specific event/emotion]."

**Prompt 2 — Turning point:**
> "The biggest pivot was when [specific event].
> I realized [lesson], and that's when I decided [action]."

**Prompt 3 — Now:**
> "Today I help [specific audience] by [method].
> What I believe most strongly is [core philosophy]."

### Important guidelines

- Story arc **must be authentic** — no fabrication, no embellishment
- You don't need a "rags to riches" arc — any genuine journey has value
- The Chapter 2 failure doesn't have to be huge — it can be a "dead end"
- Story arc shows up in: bio, About page, podcast intro, foundational essays
- Update Chapter 3 every 6 months (where are you now?)

---

## Risk & Ethics

### 5 common risks

| Risk | Severity | Prevention |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Burnout** | High | Batch content, take 1 week off per quarter, don't chase the algorithm |
| **Fake authority** | High | Only claim what you've DONE, not what you've READ |
| **Over-promising** | Medium | Commit to realistic outcomes, never "guarantee success" |
| **Privacy loss** | Medium | Distinguish "share" vs "expose"; family is not content |
| **AI dependency** | Low-Medium | AI assists, doesn't replace your voice |

### Ethical principles

1. **No fake expert** — don't claim experience you don't have
2. **No AI deception** — if AI wrote it, don't say "I wrote this"
3. **AI disclosure** — note AI assistance when content is materially generated
4. **No copying others' frameworks** — credit sources or build your own
5. **Don't sell courses before you have results** — sell experience, not promises

### Global market context

> "The US/EU LinkedIn ecosystem is mature, but emerging markets (LATAM, SEA, India) are growing fastest. For founders/coaches outside Tier 1 markets: building a personal brand now is an early-mover advantage. Cross-border content (English-first with localized examples) reaches the widest audience."
