## 1. Newbie Guide

### What is audio AI and how is it different from video AI?

Audio AI is the tech behind synthetic voices that sound nearly human — from a sample of your voice, AI learns and produces a synthetic clone (voice clone). You write text -> AI reads it back (Text-to-Speech).

**Differences vs video AI:**
- Video AI (skill 24): produces video with face + voice -> talking head, social video
- Audio AI (this skill): produces voice only -> podcast, audiobook, voiceover, narration

### When to use audio AI instead of video?

| Situation | Pick audio AI | Pick video AI |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Long-form content (>10 min) | YES — podcast format | NO — too long for video |
| Don't want to be on camera | YES | NO |
| Need volume content fast | YES — 1 podcast = 10 shorts | YES but more expensive |
| Audience listens while driving / at gym | YES | NO |
| Need visuals to demo | NO | YES |
| Personal brand thought leader | YES — podcast = authority | YES — if face brand exists |

### Main tools (international)

- **ElevenLabs:** Best in class for voice clone — top-tier English voices (US/UK/AU/IN), 30+ languages
- **Murf:** 120+ voice library, strong for corporate voiceover, multilingual
- **PlayHT:** API-friendly, instant clone, 800+ voices
- **HeyGen Voice:** Bundles with HeyGen avatars — seamless voice + video pipeline
- **Descript:** AI editing — cut audio by editing text, voice clone (Overdub)
- **Resemble.ai:** Custom emotion control, brand-grade APIs
- **Riverside:** Studio-quality podcast recording with AI Magic Clips repurpose

### Time and cost

| Task | Time | Cost (USD/mo) |
|------|------|---------------|
| Voice clone setup | 30-60 min | $5-22 (ElevenLabs Starter/Pro) |
| 60s voiceover (TikTok) | 5-10 min | $5-22 |
| 30 min solo podcast | 1-2 hrs | $22-99 (ElevenLabs + Riverside) |
| Audiobook chapter (15 min) | 30-45 min | $22-99 |
| 1 podcast -> 10 clips | 1-2 hrs | $0-30 (Descript/Opus Clip) |

### 5 common mistakes

1. **AI voice sounds robotic:** sample too short or monotonic. Fix: re-record 3-5 minutes with varied emotions (happy, serious, sad).
2. **Mispronounced names/jargon:** TTS engines mishandle proper nouns. Fix: use phonetic spelling (e.g., "Anthropic" -> "an-THROW-pic") in the script.
3. **Audio clipping:** levels too hot. Fix: target -3dB peak, -16 LUFS loudness.
4. **Background noise/echo:** untreated room. Fix: small room with curtains and rugs, or apply NVIDIA Broadcast / Krisp / Adobe Enhance Speech.
5. **Boring podcast:** no editing, too many "ums". Fix: Descript auto-removes filler words, add light background music (-25dB).

## 4. Three use cases

### Use case A: Short voiceover for TikTok/Reels (Energetic)

**Spec:**
- Length: 15-60s
- Pace: fast (180-220 wpm) — younger English-speaking audience
- Tone: energetic, slightly higher pitch, exciting
- Audio levels: -14 LUFS (TikTok), peak -1 dB
- CTA: clear in the last 5 seconds

**Script template (30s):**
```
[HOOK 0-3s] "Did you know [shocking stat]?"
[PROBLEM 3-10s] "Most people are still stuck in [wrong loop]"
[SOLUTION 10-22s] "I tried [method], and here are 3 things..."

## 6. 1-on-1 podcast with an AI co-host

> **Use case:** solo podcaster who wants conversational format but can't find a co-host. AI co-host = a second AI voice that asks questions while you answer.

### Setup — prompt-engineering the AI personality

**Step 1: Define the AI co-host's personality**
```
Name: [AI co-host name]
Personality: curious, asks deep follow-ups, occasionally light humor
Role: asks the host questions, doesn't talk too much
Speaking style: casual, natural, addresses the host by first name
Knowledge level: average — asks questions like a listener would
Catchphrases: "Wow, that's wild." / "What does that mean exactly?" / "Can you go deeper?"
```

**Step 2: Create a separate voice clone for the AI co-host**
- Use a different voice than the host (e.g., woman vs man, or different accent)
- Clone from a consenting friend, or use one of ElevenLabs' built-in voices

**Step 3: Tool stack**
- **ElevenLabs:** generate the AI co-host voice
- **Riverside:** record the host live
- **Descript:** edit + splice in the AI co-host (text-to-audio)

### Q&A script template

```
[INTRO]
Host: Hey everyone, today [AI co-host] and I are diving into...
AI co-host: Hi all, I'm [name]. Today I want to dig into [topic] from [host]'s
            point of view. Let's go!

[BODY — 5-7 Q&A pairs]
AI co-host: [Broad opening question]
Host: [Answers 2-3 minutes]
AI co-host: [Deeper follow-up]
Host: [Answers with a concrete example]
... repeat 5-7 times ...

[OUTRO]
AI co-host: Thanks [host] for sharing. The biggest thing I learned was...
Host: Thanks [AI co-host]. If you have questions, drop them in the comments...
```

**Tip:** pre-write 7-10 AI co-host questions in a doc, record host responses in one go. Then generate AI co-host audio in ElevenLabs and splice in via Descript.

## 7. Repurpose pipeline 1:10 (1 podcast -> 10 short clips)

### Workflow overview

```
[1] Record 60-min podcast (Riverside)
        v
[2] Auto-transcript (Descript / Riverside)
        v
[3] Identify hooks (10-15 quotable lines)
        v
[4] Cut 30-60s clips per quote (Opus Clip / Descript)
        v
[5] Add captions (auto-caption)
        v
[6] Distribute across 4 platforms
```

### How to identify hooks

Find moments in the transcript with these traits:
- **Bold statement:** "I think 90% of founders are doing this wrong"
- **Counter-intuitive:** "Raising prices actually grew revenue"
- **Specific number:** "Went from $0 to $1M in 6 months"
- **Personal story:** "On my first startup I lost $200K"
- **Actionable tip:** "3 specific steps you can take today"

> **Target:** 10-15 hooks per 60-min podcast. Pick the 10 best.

### Tool stack

- **Descript:** auto-clip — select sentences, export short clips (free tier 1 hr/month)
- **Opus Clip:** AI auto-finds viral moments + auto-format vertical/horizontal ($19-99)
- **Riverside Magic Clips:** built-in to Riverside Pro ($29)
- **CapCut + ChatGPT:** manual but free — paste transcript, ChatGPT extracts hook candidates

### Distribution across 4 platforms

| Platform | Format | Length | Caption | Bonus |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| **TikTok** | 9:16 (1080×1920) | 30-60s | Bold caption on top | Trend audio overlay (low volume) |
| **Instagram Reels** | 9:16 | 15-90s | Clean subtitle, sans-serif font | Strong cover image |
| **YouTube Shorts** | 9:16 | <60s | Auto-caption | Title with target keyword |
| **LinkedIn audio** | 1:1 (square video w/ audio) | 60-120s | Subtitle below | Long-form thread (carousel) |

**Pro tip:** each clip should target one platform with platform-specific captions and cover image. Maximizes reach.

## 8. Audio QA + Disclosure

### 5 QA criteria

1. **Clarity (10 pts):** voice clear, no rasp, no stuttering. Test: play on phone speaker, still intelligible.
