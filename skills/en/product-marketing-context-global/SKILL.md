description: "Use when starting work on a new product, client, or market — this skill creates the file `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md` that 60+ other global skills read before they write anything: product, ICP, positioning, proof, objections, brand voice, pricing, and KPIs, with a region variant for US, EU, SEA, or LATAM. Run once, reuse forever. Trigger on 'set up marketing context', 'new client setup', 'onboard a new product', 'the AI does not know my product', 'US marketing context', 'EU GDPR setup', 'SEA market context', 'LATAM setup'. Also use when the user complains every answer comes back generic because nothing about the business was ever provided. Not for — a personal brand belonging to a founder, coach, or creator, see `22-personal-brand-context-global`; deep persona and JTBD research, see `09-customer-insight-global`; the period plan itself, see `00-marketing-plan-global`."

# Product Marketing Context (Global Foundation)

> **Foundation skill for the GLOBAL marketing cluster** — runs BEFORE every other global skill (00-29). Creates `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md` with product, customer, positioning context tuned to a specific region. Parallel to `product-marketing-context` (the Vietnam foundation); this one serves 4 regions: US, EU, SEA, LATAM.

---

## For newbies

### Who is this skill for?

| Audience | Concrete example |
|----------|------------------|
| Founder going international | Already in Vietnam, expanding to US/EU/SEA |
| Global SaaS / DTC brand | Multi-region launch needing region-specific context per market |
| Agency serving international clients | Onboarding a US, EU, SEA, or LATAM client |
| Marketer entering a new market | Setting up positioning for a new geography |

### Who is this NOT for?

- **Vietnam-only marketing** -> Use `product-marketing-context` (VN foundation) instead
- **Personal brand (founder/coach/creator)** -> Use `22-personal-brand-context-global` (when available)
- **Single ad campaign** -> Use `02-campaign-brief-global` directly; you do not need a full context file

### 30-second pre-read

This skill produces ONE region-tagged file (`.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md`) with 12 sections describing your product, customers, competitors, positioning. Pick 1 of 4 region variants (US, EU, SEA, LATAM) — the variant tunes currency, platforms, regulations, persona framework. Every global skill (00-29) reads this file before working — like a medical chart every doctor reads first.

### 3 common errors

1. **Wrong region variant** — "I sell in 5 countries" -> pick PRIMARY market first; multi-region later.
2. **Mixing currencies** — Mixed USD/EUR/local without a primary anchor confuses downstream skills.
3. **Skipping regulations** — GDPR/CCPA/PDPA/LGPD shape data collection; ignoring breaks campaigns at launch.

---

## Why do you need this skill?

Without this file, every global marketing skill has to re-ask: What is the product? Who is the customer? Which region? Currency? Regulations? Platforms? Repetitive, slow, inconsistent.

With `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md`:
- Answer ONCE at project start
- Every skill reads it automatically -> straight to work
- Region defaults (currency, platforms, regulations) propagate everywhere
- No drift between skills — copy and report use the same persona, currency, metrics

---

## Workflow

```
Step 1: Check existing file
    |-- exists  -> ask which section to update
    |-- missing -> Step 2
Step 2: Choose region variant (US / EU / SEA / LATAM)
Step 3: Collect info per variant (12 sections)
Step 4: Create file `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md`
```

---

## Step 1: Check existing file

Check whether `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md` already exists.

- **If it exists** -> read the file, summarize, ask user which section to update. Only collect info for that section.
- **If it does not exist** -> proceed to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Choose region variant

Ask the user one question: **"Which is your PRIMARY region: US, EU, SEA, or LATAM?"**

### Decision tree

```
Where is your primary market?
    |-- North America (USA, Canada)
    |       --> 01-us.md    (USD, FTC + CCPA, Meta + Google + TikTok)
    |-- European Union (UK, DE, FR, ES, IT, NL, etc.)
    |       --> 02-eu.md    (EUR, GDPR + EU AI Act, Meta + Google + LinkedIn)
    |-- Southeast Asia EXCEPT Vietnam (SG, MY, ID, TH, PH)
    |       --> 03-sea.md   (USD or local, PDPA, TikTok + Shopee/Lazada)
    |-- Latin America (BR, MX, AR, CO, CL)
    |       --> 04-latam.md (USD or local, LGPD, WhatsApp + Meta + Mercado Libre)
    |-- Vietnam only
    |       --> Use `product-marketing-context` (VN foundation) — NOT this skill
    |-- Multi-region (>2 regions equally important)
            --> Pick the LARGEST market as primary; note others in section 12
```

### Detection logic

1. User says explicitly ("we sell in the US") -> load matching variant
2. User vague ("we sell internationally") -> ask which country has the most revenue today
3. Truly multi-region -> pick primary market; add secondary markets in section 12 (Goals)

---

## Step 3: Collect info per variant

After choosing the variant, read the matching file in `variants/` and walk through each section:

1. **Brief explanation** — what this section captures and why it matters
2. **Ask 1-3 questions** — one section at a time, NEVER all at once
3. **Confirm** — read back; user confirms
4. **Move to next section**

**Notes:**
- Every variant has 12 sections (matching the VN foundation structure)
- All 4 variants share the same skeleton but have DIFFERENT defaults, examples, and region-specific notes
- Region cues: currency format, platform list, regulation pointer, cultural context

Variant summary:
- `variants/01-us.md` — USD, FTC + CCPA, Meta + Google + TikTok, JTBD + ICP
- `variants/02-eu.md` — EUR, GDPR + EU AI Act, Meta + Google + LinkedIn, GDPR-compliant ICP
- `variants/03-sea.md` — USD or local, PDPA, TikTok + Shopee/Lazada + LINE, mobile-first persona
- `variants/04-latam.md` — USD or local, LGPD, WhatsApp + Meta + Mercado Libre, WhatsApp-first persona

---

## Step 4: Create the file

Save to `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md` (create the `.agents/` folder if missing).

```markdown
# Product Marketing Context (Global) — [Product name]

> Region variant: [US / EU / SEA / LATAM]
> Primary currency: [USD / EUR / SGD / BRL / etc.]
> Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
> Compatible with: Claude Code, ChatGPT, Gemini, any AI agent

---

[12 sections following the chosen variant]
```

---

## How other skills use this file

In every global marketing skill (00-marketing-plan-global, 05-ad-copy-global, etc.), add this block under "Collect info":

```markdown
## Collect info

### Step 0: Check global context file

Check whether `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md` exists:
- **Yes** -> Read everything; pull product / customer / region / currency / regulation context. Do NOT re-ask.
- **No**  -> Suggest user run `product-marketing-context-global` first.
  If user wants to continue anyway, ask 2-3 minimum questions about product + region.
```

**Skills that will read this file:** `00-marketing-plan-global`, `01-content-calendar-global`, `02-campaign-brief-global`, ... `29-*` (all global cluster skills).

## Quality checklist

- [ ] File saved at `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md`
- [ ] Region variant tagged at the top (US / EU / SEA / LATAM)
- [ ] All 12 sections completed (or at least 8 core: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12)
- [ ] Currency format matches region (e.g. `$9.99` for US, `€9,99` for EU)
- [ ] Voice of customer (section 9) uses REAL quotes — not paraphrased
- [ ] Anti-persona explicit (section 7); 3 concrete differentiators (section 6)
- [ ] North Star Metric defined (section 12); last-updated date in file
