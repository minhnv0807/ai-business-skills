# Global Campaign Brief

> 9-section creative brief: Context, Objectives, Target, Core Message, Creative Direction, Channel System, Timeline, Deliverables, Risks. Auto-triggers downstream skills (script, calendar, ad copy, UGC brief).

---

## Step 0 — Read context file

Before writing the brief, read `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md` to load:

- Product, USP, pricing
- Target region and currency
- Brand voice & visual identity
- Existing campaigns and lessons learned

If the file is missing, ask the user to run `product-marketing-context-global` first.

---

## Information gathering

Ask the user up to 4 questions before starting:

1. **Campaign type?** Product launch / seasonal / brand awareness / clearance sale / re-launch?
2. **Primary goal?** Revenue [amount] / followers [count] / leads [count] / brand awareness [reach target]?
3. **Budget and timeframe?** Total budget, campaign duration (in weeks), start date.
4. **Existing assets?** Brand assets (logo, brand guide)? Testimonials / UGC? Existing customer database? Landing page?

## Section 3 — Target audience

### 3.1 Customer profile

| Attribute | Primary | Secondary |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Age range | [range] | [range] |
| Gender | [male / female / all] | |
| Region | [country / region] | |

### 3.2 Customer insight

> Call skill `09-customer-insight-global` to mine deeper insight.

**Core insight:** [insight statement]

### 3.3 Insight validation checklist

Verify the insight is actually an insight and not just an observation:

| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Specific** — Specific to this audience, not generic? | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Hidden** — Customer would not say it spontaneously? | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Actionable** — Can be turned into messaging / creative? | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Emotional** — Hits emotion, not only logic? | [ ] | [ ] |
| **True** — Backed by data / observation, not assumption? | [ ] | [ ] |

**Rule:** Must pass at least 4 / 5. Otherwise it is an observation, not an insight. Mine again.

**Distinguish:**

- Observation: "Women 25–35 care about skincare" — everyone knows this, nothing new.
- Insight: "They buy serum not to have better skin — they buy a moment of self-care after an exhausting day." — emotional, actionable for creative.
