description: "Use when the user needs to WRITE a marketing report someone else will read — a one-page weekly for a CEO, a full monthly, or a quarterly strategy report with TL;DR, results versus target, insight, decisions needed, and next actions with owners. Trigger on 'marketing report', 'monthly report', 'weekly update for my boss', 'report for the client', 'quarterly summary', 'turn these numbers into a report'. Also use when the user says a stakeholder is asking how marketing is doing. Not for — diagnosing why the numbers are bad, see `03-performance-eval-global`; turning a raw export into insight, see `13-data-analysis-global`; a closed campaign retrospective, see `63-campaign-retrospective-global`."

# Marketing Report (Global)

## Information gathering

Ask up to 4 questions before reporting:

1. **Reporting period?** Week (which week, from-to dates) or month (month/year)?
2. **Available data?** Provide: ad spend, messages, leads, bookings, customers, revenue. If incomplete, note what's missing to ask.
3. **Targets set?** What KPIs were committed for this period? (revenue, leads, CPMess, ROAS). If none — use industry benchmarks.
4. **Channels running?** Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, Google Ads, Organic (TikTok, Facebook, Email/SMS). List all.

---

## Core principles

### "Read 5 minutes, know what to do next"

Every report must answer these 4 questions in order:

1. **How were results?** — Did we hit targets? (1 sentence)
2. **What's working?** — Keep, scale up (2-3 points)
3. **What's not working?** — Fix, root cause (2-3 points)
4. **What to do next?** — Specific recs with deadlines and owners

### Order of presentation

```
Insight FIRST -> Numbers AS PROOF -> Action RECOMMENDATIONS
```

Never list numbers and let reader draw conclusions. Always state insight first, numbers as evidence.

### 3 comparison frames

Each metric must compare against at least 1 of these 3 frames:

| Frame | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| vs Target | Hit or miss committed KPI | CPMess target $1.20 — actual $1.10 (hit) |
| vs Previous Period | Up/down vs prior month/week | CPMess last month $1.40 -> this month $1.10 (-21%) |
| vs Industry Benchmark | Better/worse than market average | Beauty industry CPMess $1.00-$1.60 — ours $1.10 (good) |

### 4. Auto diagnosis

```markdown
## 4. Diagnosis: What's good — What's bad — Why

### Working well (KEEP + SCALE)
| # | Finding | Numbers | Reason | Action |
|---|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | [e.g., UGC video creative low CPMess] | [CPMess $0.90 vs avg $1.20] | [Natural format, strong hook] | Scale: +30% budget, shoot 5 more UGC |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |

### Not working (FIX URGENTLY)
| # | Issue | Numbers | Root cause | Severity | Action |
|---|-------|---------|------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | [e.g., Booking->Show low] | [28% vs target 40%] | [No 24h reminder, no deposit] | High | Auto reminder + collect $5 deposit |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |

### Unclear (MONITOR FURTHER)
| # | Observation | Numbers | Hypothesis | Validation method | Timeline |
|---|-------------|---------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | [e.g., CTR dropping over 4 weeks] | [2.1% -> 1.4%] | [Ad fatigue] | Swap creative, monitor 1 week | 7 days |
```

---

### 5. Action recommendations

```markdown
## 5. Action Recommendations

| # | Action | Goal | Deadline | Owner | Status |
|---|--------|------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | [e.g., Shoot 5 new UGC for Meta Ads] | CPMess <$1.00 | [DD/MM] | [Name] | Not started |
| 2 | [e.g., Set up auto reminder 24h] | Booking->Show >40% | [DD/MM] | [Name] | Not started |
| 3 | [e.g., Test TikTok Ads $200/wk] | New channel, CPMess <$1.40 | [DD/MM] | [Name] | Not started |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |

**Priority:** Number by impact level — do 1 + 2 first, 3 + 4 + 5 next week.
```

### 6. Next month plan

```markdown
## 6. Plan for [Month X+1]

### Targets

| Metric | This Mo (actual) | Next Mo (target) | Increase | Basis |
|--------|------------------|------------------|----------|-------|
| Revenue | [X] | [X] | [+X%] | [Why this is achievable] |
| MKT spend | [X] | [X] | [+/-X%] | |
| ROAS | [X] | [X] | [+X] | |
| New customers | [X] | [X] | [+X%] | |

| Week 2 | [e.g., Scale winners + cut losers] | [X] | [ROAS >3x] |
| Week 3 | [e.g., Push BOFU + retarget] | [X] | [Close rate >40%] |
| Week 4 | [e.g., Wrap up + prep next month] | [X] | [Hit revenue target] |

### Budget allocation

| Category | Amount | % | Note |
|----------|--------|---|------|
| Meta Ads | [X] | [X%] | |
| TikTok Ads | [X] | [X%] | |

```

### 7. Chart specs (for design team)

If report needs presentation to stakeholders (boss, client), create charts:

| # | Chart | Type | X-axis | Y-axis | Note |
|---|-------|------|--------|--------|------|
| 1 | Revenue vs Spend by week | Line chart (2 lines) | Wk 1-4 | USD | 2 colors: green (revenue), red (spend) |
| 2 | Conversion funnel | Funnel chart | Funnel step | Volume | Impression -> Customer |
| 3 | CPMess by week | Bar chart | Wk 1-4 | USD | Add target line (dashed) |
| 4 | Budget allocation | Pie chart | — | % | By channel (Meta, TikTok, Google, Content) |
| 5 | This Mo vs Last Mo | Grouped bar chart | Metric | Value | 2 colors: green (this), gray (last) |

**Recommended tools:** Google Sheets/Looker Studio (free), Canva (presentation).

## Weekly report template (compact)

Weekly report shorter than monthly — keep parts 1, 4, 5 only:

```markdown
# Weekly Report [X]: [DD/MM-DD/MM/YYYY]

## Quick results
| Metric | Wk Target | Actual | vs Last Wk | Rating |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------|--------|
| Spend | | | | |
| Messages | | | | |
| CPMess | | | | |
| Leads | | | | |
| Bookings | | | | |
| Customers | | | | |
| Revenue | | | | |

## Good / Bad
- GOOD: [1-2 points]
- BAD: [1-2 points]

## Next week actions
| # | Task | Owner | Deadline |
|---|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
```

## Quality checklist

Check before delivering report:

- [ ] Has weekly data (not just monthly totals)
- [ ] Has top 3 best ads + bottom 3 ads (with specific numbers)
- [ ] Has conversion funnel — points out bottleneck
- [ ] Diagnosis has root cause, not just description
- [ ] Action recs have deadline and owner — not generic
- [ ] Has next month plan with targets and budget
- [ ] No unsourced numbers (every number from dashboard or specific report)
- [ ] Charts (if any) have clear specs for design team
- [ ] Total report length: read in 5 minutes — cut excess
