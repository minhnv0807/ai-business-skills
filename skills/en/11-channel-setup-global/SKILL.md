# Channel Setup A-Z (Global)

Setup marketing channels for global businesses — selection, platform-specific checklists, integration guides. Region variants (US/EU/SEA/LATAM) provide localized platform priorities.

---

## For newbies — Read this first

If you've never set up marketing channels:

1. **Don't start with all channels.** Pick 2-3 max for the first 90 days. More channels = thinner attention = worse results.
2. **Channel selection depends on your audience, not your preference.** If your customers live on TikTok, Email won't work no matter how much you love Email.
3. **Region matters massively.** WhatsApp dominates LATAM. LINE dominates Thailand. LinkedIn dominates B2B in DE/UK. Don't import US assumptions.
4. **Each channel has 4 setup phases:** Create, Verify, Integrate, Run first 30 days. Skipping phases leads to weak performance later.
5. **Tech stack < Process.** A perfect Meta Pixel doesn't matter if no one is making content. Setup the publishing rhythm first.
6. **Trust takes 30-90 days.** Don't expect ROAS in week 1. Channels need data + content rhythm + audience to mature.
7. **Compliance is per-region.** GDPR (EU), CCPA (US), LGPD (BR), PDPA (TH) — each has rules for tracking, opt-in, and data handling.

---

## Step 0 — Read context + select region variant

Before setting up:

1. **Read `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md`** — get product, audience, region, target channels.
2. **Pick region variant for platform priority list:**
   - `variants/01-us.md` — North America
   - `variants/02-eu.md` — Europe (GDPR-aware)
   - `variants/03-sea.md` — Southeast Asia
   - `variants/04-latam.md` — Latin America (WhatsApp-first)
3. **See cross-platform comparison:** `references/global-platforms-comparison.md`

### Information gathering

Ask user up to 4 questions:

1. **Which channels are you considering?** (Meta / Google / TikTok / LinkedIn / WhatsApp / LINE / Shopee / Mercado Libre / email — you can pick multiple)
2. **Industry, product, target audience?** What you sell, to whom, in which countries?
3. **Existing channels?** List current channels, follower count, status.
4. **90-day goal?** Followers? Leads? Orders? Brand awareness?
