# Ad Copy (Global)

## Step 0: Check context file

Before writing ad copy, read context file (if exists):

1. `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` (product marketing)
2. `.agents/personal-brand-context.md` (personal brand)

Decide mode:
- Only `product-marketing-context.md` exists -> **MODE A** (default — 6 TOFU/MOFU/BOFU variations)
- Only `personal-brand-context.md` exists -> **MODE B** (Personal Brand Mode)
- Both exist -> **ASK 1 question**: "Are you running ads to sell a product or boost personal brand?"
- Neither exists -> Suggest creating appropriate context

---

## Information gathering

Ask up to 4 questions before writing:

1. **What product / service?** Short description, main USP, price, current promotion (if any).
2. **Which ad platform?** Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram), TikTok Ads, Google Ads. If not specified — default to Meta Ads.
3. **Target audience?** Gender, age range, main pain point, decision maker. Cold (unaware) or Warm (engaged)?
4. **Ad objective?** Messages (DM), Lead form, Traffic, Conversions. If not specified — default to Messages.

---

## Core principles

### 125-character rule

On Meta Ads, only the **first 125 characters** show before "See more" button. Line 1 of primary text must:
- Spark curiosity OR hit pain point
- Include USP or specific number
- Be self-contained (don't cut mid-sentence)

```
GOOD:  "Tired of acne for 3+ years? A 28-day routine — guaranteed clear skin or refund."  (76 chars)
BAD:   "Hello there, thank you for your interest in our services. Today I want to share..." (cut mid-sentence)
```

### Emotional trigger library

| # | Trigger | Description | Example |
|---|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Pain | Hit current problem — create empathy | "Tired of breakouts? You're not alone..." |
| 2 | Aspiration | Paint a better future image | "Imagine clear, confident skin without filters" |
| 3 | FOMO | Fear of missing out, scarcity | "Only 12 slots left this month — 89 people booked" |
| 4 | Social Proof | Others did and succeeded | "1,200 customers tried — 4.8/5 stars" |
| 5 | Authority | Experts, certifications, experience | "10 years experience — board-certified dermatologist consults directly" |
| 6 | Curiosity | Spark questions, want to know more | "There's 1 thing 90% of skincare users get wrong — do you know?" |

**Trigger rules by funnel:**
- TOFU: Curiosity (6), Pain (1), Aspiration (2)
- MOFU: Social Proof (4), Authority (5), Pain (1)
- BOFU: FOMO (3), Social Proof (4), Pain (1)

## 6 Professional Copy Frameworks

### Choose framework by audience temperature

| Temperature | Priority frameworks | Why |
|-------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Cold** (unaware) | AIDA, Star·Story·Solution | Logic from scratch; storytelling without ad-feel |
| **Warm** (engaged, no purchase) | PAS, 4P | Re-trigger pain; build trust with proof |
| **Hot** (high intent, near purchase) | FAB, BAB | Hammer specific benefits; visual transformation |
| **Retarget** (viewed, no purchase) | PAS or BAB | Reinforce consequences or transformation |

### Framework summary

| Framework | Structure | When to use | Best platforms |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **AIDA** | Attention -> Interest -> Desire -> Action | Cold audience, new product launch | Meta feed, TikTok, YouTube pre-roll |
| **PAS** | Problem -> Agitate -> Solution | Warm audience, clear pain (spa, health, edu) | Meta feed, LinkedIn, Google RSA |
| **BAB** | Before -> After -> Bridge | Transformation offer (spa, fitness, edu) | Meta Reels/Stories, TikTok |
| **4P** | Promise -> Picture -> Proof -> Push | High-ticket, requires trust (real estate, courses, B2B) | LinkedIn, Google, long Meta feed |
| **FAB** | Features -> Advantages -> Benefits | High-intent, comparison stage | Google RSA, Meta retarget |
| **Star·Story·Solution** | Star -> Story -> Solution | Brand storytelling, UGC-style, no ad-feel | TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts |

> **Common mistake:** Writing freeform (intro -> features -> CTA) instead of using a framework. Result: bland copy, low CTR. Each of the 6 variations should use a **different framework**.

### Andromeda Warning — Don't clone ads

> **Meta 2026:** Andromeda system clusters ads with **Creative Similarity Score > 60%** — auto-reduces delivery. 100 minor variations (color swap, clip cut, font change) is NOT better than 10 truly distinct creatives.

**Safety thresholds:**

| Similarity Score | Status | Action |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| < 40% | Safe | Continue |
| 40-60% | Warning | Re-check — may cluster |
| > 60% | Danger | Andromeda clusters -> auto delivery cut |

**5 dimensions of diversity:**
1. **Different hooks** — Pain vs Curiosity vs Aspiration (not just text swap, change angle)
2. **Different formats** — Vertical 9:16 vs Square 1:1 vs Carousel
3. **Different characters** — Founder vs Customer review vs KOC/expert
4. **Different audio** — Trending music vs Inspirational vs Voiceover
5. **Different settings** — Studio vs Outdoor vs UGC living room

---

### 6 ad hook types — Line 1 decides everything

First 125 chars = ad hook. Each variation should use a **different hook type**:

| # | Hook type | Formula | Example |
|---|-----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Number** | Specific, surprising stat | "1,247 customers tried — 98% returned for round 2" |
| 2 | **Counterintuitive** | Flip common belief | "Running MORE ads won't get you more customers" |
| 3 | **Before/After** | Specific transformation | "From 5 orders/week to 40 orders/week — in 60 days" |
| 4 | **Borrowed authority** | Name expert/cert/brand | "Top dermatologist with 15 years experience recommends — surprising reason" |
| 5 | **Confession** | Share real mistake/lesson | "I burned $200K on bad ads — here's what I do now" |
| 6 | **Urgency** | Time/quantity limit | "8 slots left this June — 34 people waiting" |

**Hook selection by funnel:**
- TOFU (cold): Hook 1 (number), 2 (counterintuitive) — grab attention
- MOFU (warm): Hook 3 (before/after), 4 (authority) — build trust
- BOFU (hot): Hook 5 (confession), 6 (urgency) — drive action

**Hook check:**
- [ ] Line 1 <= 125 chars and self-contained
- [ ] Includes specific number or detail (not generic)
- [ ] Sparks curiosity or emotional hit — reader WANTS to click "See more"
- [ ] 6 variations use 6 DIFFERENT hook types

---

### Copy Scoring — Score before delivery

Score on 5 criteria, 1-10 each. **Only deliver if >= 35/50.**

| Criterion | 8-10 points | 5-7 points | 1-4 points |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Hook strength** | Strong curiosity, specific number/detail, funnel-fit | Acceptable but unimpressive | Generic, no anchor |
| **Emotional trigger** | Clear trigger (Pain/FOMO/Social proof), felt | Has trigger but mild | No trigger, no feeling |
| **CTA clarity** | Specific, clear action, single step | CTA exists but unclear | Vague ("Learn more", "Click here") |
| **Compliance** | 0 policy violations | 1 mild warning | Clear violation = rejected |
| **Platform fit** | Char limit correct, voice matches platform | Close enough | Wrong limit or wrong voice |

| Total | Rating | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 45-50 | Excellent | Ship now, monitor performance |
| 35-44 | Good | Ship with improvement notes |
| 25-34 | Average | Revise before shipping |
| < 25 | Weak | Rewrite from scratch |

> **Add this line to every output:** `Copy Score: [X]/50 — [Rating]`

### Platform rules

| Rule | Meta Ads | TikTok Ads | Google Ads |
|------|----------|------------|------------|
| Primary text length | 125 char line 1 + 300-500 full | 80-100 char (text overlay) | No primary text |
| Headline | Max 40 char | None | Max 30 char x 3 |
| Description | Max 30 char | None | Max 90 char x 2 |
| Voice | Professional but friendly | Young, natural, conversational | Direct, keyword-driven |
| CTA button | Pick from Meta list | No button — CTA in text | No button — CTA in headline |
| Image / Video | 1:1 (feed), 9:16 (story/reel) | 9:16 mandatory | N/A (search) |

### CTA — Priority order

Specific > vague. Clear action > ambiguous.

| Strength | CTA | When to use |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Strongest | "Message us to book a slot" | Messages goal, BOFU |
| Strong | "Book free consultation" | Lead form, MOFU/BOFU |
| Medium | "See pricing details" | Traffic, MOFU |
| Light | "Learn more" | Awareness, TOFU |

**Avoid:** Generic CTAs without action ("Click here", "Contact now").

### Ad policy compliance checklist

| Rule | Detail | Violation = ad rejected |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| No absolute claims | Avoid "guaranteed", "100%", "definitely" | Yes |
| No "free" in headline | Meta flags "free" in headline — use in body instead | Yes |
| No excessive "promo" | Once in body — no repeat | Yes |
| No personal attributes | Avoid "Are you fat?", "Do you have acne?" — use "Many people experience..." | Yes |
| Realistic before/after | No heavy retouching of before/after photos | Yes |
| No sensitive imagery | No close-up acne, wounds, body parts | Yes |
| Mandatory disclaimer | Supplements, medical — disclaimer required | Yes |

## Dropshipping Mode

> Activates when user mentions: "dropshipping", "shopify product", "winning product".
> Different from regular ad copy — focused on impulse purchase, urgency, scarcity.

### 4 Dropshipping Ad Templates

**Template 1: Urgency Hook**
- Primary text: "Selling out FAST — only 27 units left in stock! Get yours before midnight..."
- Headline: "Almost Gone"
- CTA: "Shop Now"

**Template 2: Scarcity Hook**
- Primary text: "We can only restock this every 6 weeks. If you've been thinking about it..."
- Headline: "Limited Restock"
- CTA: "Order Now"

**Template 3: Problem-Aware Hook**
- Primary text: "Tired of [pain point]? This [product] solves it in 30 seconds. Watch how ->"
- Headline: "Solved In 30 Seconds"
- CTA: "Learn More"

**Template 4: Transformation Hook**
- Primary text: "Before: [problem image] -> After: [solution image]. Real customer photo, no editing."
- Headline: "Before & After"
- CTA: "See How"

### Dropshipping Ad Copy Rules

1. **Use specific numbers** — "27 units" not "limited stock"
2. **Photo-first creative** — text overlays, not text-only ads
3. **Always have urgency or scarcity** — countdown, limited stock, restock date
4. **Social proof tile** — "1,247 ordered today" in primary text
5. **Free shipping mention** — if applicable, primary text line 2
