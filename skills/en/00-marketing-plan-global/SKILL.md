# Global Marketing Plan

> Master skill — calls 08-competitor-research-global, 09-customer-insight-global, 10-reverse-kpi-global before producing the final output.

---

## For newcomers

If this is your first global marketing plan, follow this order:

1. **Step 0** — Read `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md` (set once per product)
2. **Information gathering** — Answer the 4 questions below
3. **Run sub-skills** — 08 (competitors), 09 (insights), 10 (reverse KPIs)
4. **Assemble plan** — Use the 7-section template
5. **Cross-check** — Run the quality checklist

If `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md` does not exist, ask the user to run `product-marketing-context-global` first to lock down product, ICP, region, currency, and brand voice.

---

## Step 0 — Read context file

Before producing any output, read `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md` to load:

- Product / service description, USP, pricing tier
- Target region (US / EU / SEA / LATAM / APAC / GLOBAL)
- Reporting currency (USD / EUR / GBP / SGD / etc.)
- Brand voice & tone-of-voice rules
- Existing channels and audience data

If the file is missing, ask the user to create it first. Do not guess context.

---

## Information gathering

Ask the user up to 4 questions before starting:

1. **Product / service?** Short description, core USP, price tier (entry / mid / premium).
2. **Target audience?** Age range, location, occupation, behaviour, biggest pain point.
3. **Goal & budget?** Target revenue per month, marketing budget (ads + content + people), campaign duration.
4. **Stage?** Pre-launch / Launch / Growth / Mature? Existing channels with traction? Available data (followers, email list, customer database)?

> If region was not captured in context file, also ask: **Primary market?** (US / EU / SEA / LATAM / APAC / GLOBAL multi-region).
