# Client Intake Brief (Global, Generic)

> **Role of this skill:** This is the **input gate** for every marketing engagement.
>
> Other "brief" skills are produced by the agency *for* internal teams or vendors:
> - `02-campaign-brief-global` — agency drafts for execution team
> - `06-ugc-egc-brief-global` — agency drafts for creators
> - `12-landing-page-brief-global` — agency drafts for designers/devs
>
> This skill is different — it is the document the **client fills in for the agency** so the agency has structured input to plan from.

> **Note on industry variants:** v2.5 ships a single generic English template. Industry-specific variants (SaaS, DTC, healthcare, real estate, etc.) may be added in v2.6+ based on demand. The generic template is designed to work across categories — agencies should add 1–2 industry-specific questions in Section B and Section I as needed.

## For Newbies

A bad intake produces a bad plan. Most agency-client relationships fail in the first 30 days because the agency built a strategy on assumptions instead of facts.

This brief is your insurance policy. It forces the client to write down what they often only carry in their head — their actual customer, their real budget, what success means to them, what they've already tried, what's off-limits.

**Two failure modes to avoid:**
1. **Brief is too short** — agency starts work with 5 lines of context, makes wrong assumptions, three rounds of revisions follow.
2. **Brief is too long** — client abandons it halfway, fills the rest with "TBD," agency starts work blind anyway.

The 11-section template below is the minimum viable intake — designed to be completable in 30–45 minutes by a non-marketer founder.

## When to Use This Skill

| Situation | Use this skill? |
|-----------|----------------|
| New client inquiry — collect info before quoting | YES |
| Starting a new marketing project — need structured input | YES |
| Re-brief when client expands scope or pivots goals | YES |
| Onboarding a long-term retainer client | YES |
| Already have full context from extensive discovery calls — go straight to `00-marketing-plan-global` | NO |

---

## Step 0 — Read Context

Read `.agents/product-marketing-context-global.md` if it exists. The agency may already have brand-voice or template preferences captured.

---

## Step 1 — Information Gathering

Ask the agency lead up to 4 questions:

1. **What is the client's industry?** (SaaS, DTC ecommerce, healthcare, education, real estate, professional services, etc.) — used to tailor Section B and I
2. **Client size?** (Solo founder / SMB / Mid-market / Enterprise / Agency-of-record relationship)
3. **Project type?** (Launch / Re-launch / Scale / Long-term retainer / Single campaign)
4. **Delivery format?** (Fillable .md sent by email / Notion doc / Google Form / Typeform / printed in-person)

## Discovery Call Script (use this brief as the agenda)

If you fill this in collaboratively on a discovery call rather than sending it ahead:

1. **Welcome (3 min)** — agency intro, confirm goals of the call
2. **Section A walk-through (5 min)** — quick business overview
3. **Sections B–C (15 min)** — products and target audience deep dive
4. **Section D (10 min)** — competitive landscape, positioning aspiration
5. **Section E (10 min)** — pin down specific KPIs with numbers
6. **Section F (10 min)** — budget reality-check and timeline
7. **Sections G–H (10 min)** — what's already in place
8. **Section I (10 min)** — brand voice, references, constraints
9. **Sections J–K (5 min)** — confirm deliverables, capture extras
10. **Wrap-up (2 min)** — confirm next steps and proposal timeline

Total: ~80 minutes. Schedule 90 to leave buffer.

---

## How the Skill Runs

### Step 1 — Detect industry
From the agency lead's input, identify the client's industry. The generic v2.5 template adapts via the agency adding 1–2 industry-specific questions to Sections B and I.

### Step 2 — Generate the brief file
- File name: `client-intake-brief-[client-name]-[YYYYMMDD].md`
- Example: `client-intake-brief-acme-saas-20260508.md`

### Step 3 — Render the full template
Render all 11 sections (A–K) as a fillable document. Use checkboxes where the question is multi-choice, text fields where it's open. Add example answers below questions where the client may not know how to respond.

### Step 4 — Add agency cover note
Cover note at the top:
- Agency name and contact for questions
- Estimated time to complete (30–45 minutes)
- Submission deadline (default: 5–7 business days)
- What happens after they submit (review meeting + plan v1 timeline)
- Confidentiality statement

### Step 5 — Auto-trigger downstream skills
Once the client returns the completed brief, automatically suggest:

```
20-client-intake-brief-global (input received)
   |
   |-- [Next 1] 09-customer-insight-global    → Deep persona work from Section C
   |-- [Next 2] 08-competitor-research-global → Detailed audit of Section D
   |-- [Next 3] 10-reverse-kpi-calc-global    → Reverse-engineer Section E targets
   |-- [Next 4] 00-marketing-plan-global      → Synthesize into full plan
   |-- [Next 5] 02-campaign-brief-global      → Specific campaign brief(s)
```

---

## Universal Brief Design Principles

### 1. Friendly to non-marketers
- Avoid jargon (TOFU, ROAS, CPA, MQL, SQL) without explanation
- Provide example answers below each question
- Add a "Don't know — please advise" option to questions that require expertise

### 2. Structured > open-ended
- Prefer checkboxes and radio buttons for structured data
- Use 2–3 column tables for comparable items (competitors, products, team)
- Reserve long-form text only for persona, story, and constraints

### 3. Easy → hard ordering
- Start with simple business basics (Section A)
- Build up to strategic and budget decisions (Sections E–F)
- End with reflective questions (Section K)
- Client builds momentum, doesn't quit on question 3

### 4. Time-respectful
- 30–45 minutes total to complete
- Add a progress indicator ("Section A of 11")
- Optional sections marked clearly so client can return later

### 5. Closing commitment
- Client signs off that information is accurate
- Agency commits to confidentiality and use limitation
- Clear timeline (24-hour confirmation, 5–7 business day plan v1)

## Red Flags Checklist (review the returned brief)

When the client sends the brief back, scan for these warning signs before quoting:

- [ ] **"TBD" in too many fields** — they haven't done the homework. Schedule a working session.
- [ ] **Budget mismatched to goals** — "$5K to launch internationally" requires re-scoping or re-targeting.
- [ ] **No measurable KPIs** — Section E filled with adjectives ("more leads"). Force numbers before quoting.
- [ ] **Timeline impossible** — wants results "in 2 weeks" with no audience, no list, no creative. Re-set expectations.
- [ ] **Decision-maker not engaged** — brief filled by junior staff, principal hasn't seen it. Pause until you have leadership alignment.
- [ ] **Conflicting stakeholders** — Section I "do's" contradict each other (e.g., "premium luxury feel" + "aggressive discount campaigns").
- [ ] **No data, no tracking** — Section H mostly blank. Plan needs to budget for measurement setup before optimization work.
- [ ] **Recently fired previous agency** — Section G mentions a prior agency relationship that ended. Get the why before signing.
- [ ] **Compliance landmines** — Section I mentions a regulated category (health, finance, alcohol, gambling) without legal contact. Add legal review to scope.

---

## Quality Checklist (before sending to client)

## Linked Skills

- **`00-marketing-plan-global`** — once the brief returns, build the full marketing plan
- **`02-campaign-brief-global`** — turn the plan into specific campaign briefs
- **`08-competitor-research-global`** — expand Section D into detailed competitive intelligence
- **`09-customer-insight-global`** — expand Section C into deep persona research
- **`10-reverse-kpi-calc-global`** — turn Section E targets into reverse-engineered funnel math

## Notes for v2.6+

Industry variants planned (if demand justifies):
- SaaS / B2B software
- DTC ecommerce (apparel, beauty, F&B)
- Healthcare & wellness
- Real estate
- Online education & coaching
- Professional services (legal, accounting, consulting)
- Restaurants & hospitality

Each variant would override Sections B and I with industry-tuned questions while preserving the 11-section A–K structure.
