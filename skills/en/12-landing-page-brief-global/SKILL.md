# Landing Page Brief (Global)

> 1 page = 1 goal = 1 CTA. No menus, no outbound links, no distractions.

---

## Information Gathering

Ask up to 4 questions:

1. **What product/service?** Brief description + price + target audience.
2. **What is the LP goal?** Lead capture (form), booking, purchase, signup?
3. **Primary traffic source?** Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, Google Ads, organic, or mixed?
4. **What assets exist?** Product photos/video, testimonials, social proof numbers?

---

## Core Principles

### 1 page — 1 goal — 1 CTA

| Principle | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Single goal | Each page serves one action: fill a form, book a call, or buy |
| No nav menu | Remove header navigation — prevents users leaving the page |
| No outbound links | Every link should anchor-scroll to the CTA, never link out |
| Mobile-first | 70%+ of paid-ad traffic is mobile globally — design mobile first |
| <3s load | First Contentful Paint < 1.5s, Largest Contentful Paint < 3s |
| Urgency element | Countdown, limited stock, deadline — always have at least one |

### Length by Device

| Device | Total page length | Avg reading time |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Mobile | 6–8 scroll screens | 90–120 seconds |
| Desktop | 4–5 scroll screens | 60–90 seconds |

---

## 7-Section Structure

### Section 1 — Hero

| Primary CTA | Verb + benefit, contrast color (#ff6b00) | 25 chars |
| Visual | Product image/video or result shot | 1 hero asset |
| Trust badge | Customer count, ratings, partner logos | 3–5 badges |

**Copy template:**

```
Headline: [Desired result] — [Time / condition]
  Example: "Clear skin in 4 weeks — without injections"

Sub-headline: [Method/product] helps [audience] [achieve result] without [main concern].
  Example: "Our deep-facial protocol helps busy professionals reclaim healthy skin without downtime."

```

---

### Section 2 — Problem (Pain Agitation)

**Goal:** Name the exact pain so the user thinks "Yes, that's me."

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|

```
"Are you struggling with any of these?"

- [Pain 1 — specific, situational]
- [Pain 2 — consequence of the problem]

- [Pain 4 — failed past attempts]

"If even one of these resonates — [product/service] is built for you."
```

## Single-Product LP for Dropshipping

> Activates when context is dropshipping. Different from regular brand LP — laser-focused on conversion.

### Single-Product LP Structure (mobile-first)

| Section | Goal | Element |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1. Hero | Stop scroll | Hero image + bold headline + price + CTA button |
| 2. Problem-Solution | Validate problem | "Tired of X? This Y solves it" + product photos |
| 3. How it works | Build understanding | 3 steps with icons |
| 4. Social proof | Build trust | Customer photos + reviews (Loox/Judge.me) |
| 5. Features benefits | Build desire | 4-6 feature tiles |
| 6. Comparison | Differentiate | "Us vs Alternatives" table |
| 7. Urgency/Scarcity | Push decision | Stock countdown / shipping delay if delayed |
| 8. FAQ | Handle objections | 6-10 common objections answered |
| 9. CTA section | Convert | Repeat CTA + free shipping mention + guarantee |
| 10. Footer | Trust signal | Contact + return policy + privacy |

### Dropshipping LP Rules

1. **Single product per page** — never list 2+ products
2. **Mobile-first design** — 90% traffic from mobile (Meta/TikTok ads)
3. **Above-the-fold CTA** — "Add to Cart" must be visible without scrolling
4. **Stock countdown** — Beeketing, Hurrify, or built-in apps
5. **Cart abandonment recovery** — abandoned cart email automation (Klaviyo)
